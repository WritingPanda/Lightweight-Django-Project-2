# Lightweight Django Chapter 3: Building a Static Site Generator

Summary from the book:

Most static site examples involve the creation of a blogging site, like Jekyll or Hyde.
These generally include a simple set of base templates, URL patterns, and file architecture
to serve up each static page. However, even with its original intention to work in a
fast-paced environment, Django is not a web framework most developers think of using
to create static websites. In this chapter, weâ€™ll walk you through the steps to create a rapid
prototyping site with Django to help us quickly generate websites and applications (31).
